# Outline

## Introduction (14:00 - 14:15)

* Who I am
* Structure of the workshop
* Helpers
* What is exploratory data analysis
  * Very short version
* Today's scenario
  * Airbnb dataset
  * Our goal: Prediction of listing prices
* Tools
  * Notebooks (Colab)
  * Pandas
  * Plotly

## Part 1: Tool Basics (14:15 - 15:00)

*Typing everything*

* Notebook basics
* Loading CSV into Pandas
* Describing and summarising DataFrame
* Simple plots with plotly
* Tidy data
* Summary stat and plot exercises
  * ~10 mins

## Afternoon Tea (15:00 - 15:20)

## Part 2: Filtering and Calculating (15:20 - 16:20)

First: Show answers to last part's exercises

*Typing some things*

* Getting columns (DataFrames vs Series)
* Filtering
* Computing new columns
* .apply()
* Filtering and computing exercises
  * ~10 mins
  * Then show correct answers for some
  * Plots of price against accommodates and review_scores_rating will
    be better after this cleaning

## Presentation: Exploratory Data Analysis (16:20 - 16:40)

* https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html
* Origin / comparison to traditional statistics and modelling
* Importance of having a goal
* Iterative workflow
  * Ask questions
  * Get answers
  * Ask new questions
* What plots/stats to use
  * Distributions
* Careful about testing hypotheses suggested by the data

## Part 3: Grouping data and Sharing Results (16:40 - 17:40)

*Typing few things*

* Colours and facets in plotly
* Groupby in pandas
* Plots
  * https://plotly.com/python/box-plots/ can be better than histograms for groups
* Grouping exercises
  * ~10 mins
  * Then show correct answers for some
* Exporting CSVs
* Adding markdown cells
* Exporting HTML files

## Finale (17:40 - 18:00)

* Demo cool stuff like AI? Web APIs? WASM?
* Directions to continue learning
* Suggestions for continuing the analysis from the workshop
* Tools used today: Sane defaults, but not the only options
* Questions

# Additional Topics to consider

* Indexes
* Organising code with functions
