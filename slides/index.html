# Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

### Dr Ben Denham

<aside class="notes">

  * Welcome to this workshop on Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
  * My name's Ben

<div style="display: flex;">

* Getting to know the data
* Asking questions, following leads
* Testing our assumptions
* Summaries, plots, relationships
* Precursor to modelling (statistical inference, machine learning)

## The Data: <img src="images/inside-airbnb.png" style="width: 30%; margin: 0 0 -0.3em 0;">

<div style="font-size: 0.95em; display: flex;">

* **New Zealand Airbnb listings from [insideairbnb.com](https://insideairbnb.com)**
* [CC BY 4.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
* We'll explore a sample of listings from September 2023
* **Our (Broad) Goal:** Pricing a listing based on its details

<img src="images/inside-airbnb-map.png" style="width: 40%;">

</div>

<aside class="notes">

  * This is the dataset we'll be exploring today
  * Inside Airbnb collect this data to analyse the impact of short-term
    Airbnb rentals on residential housing areas
  * When performing exploratory data analysis, it is very helpful to
    have a goal in mind
  * Our eventual goal is to determine a reasonable price for an Airbnb listing,
    so we'll be interested in exploring relationships between the listing
    details of an Airbnb and its price.
  * That's not to say there's a magic formula for that - we'll see relationships
    in data are often not as simple as we'd like
  * We might also make a few detours to explore other aspects of the dataset
    along the way :)

## Why <img src="images/python-logo.png" style="height: 1.5em; margin: 0 0 -0.5em 0;"> for EDA?

<div style="font-size: 0.9em;">

* **Many libraries** for data analysis with a **global community**
* As a **general purpose language**, Python has natural paths for developing your analysis
  into:
  * A **web application or API**
  * An automated **data processing pipeline**
  * A **machine learning model**

</div>

<aside class="notes">

  * Why use Python for data analysis when other languages like R and Julia are more specifically designed for the task?
  * Not only does Python have a wide range of data libraries with a global community supporting them
  * ...but because Python is a more general purpose language, you have a lot more options for
  * ...extending your analysis into a web application, data pipeline, or machine learning model

# How to Productively Explore Data

### Inspired by: [R for Data Science - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/eda)

<aside class="notes">

  * When I was first getting into data analysis, I often didn't really know where to start, and wasn't sure if I was looking into the right things
  * This is what I would go back in time and tell myself if I could
  * This has been heavily insipred by the excellent Exploratory Data Analysis chapter in the R for Data Science book

#### There is no one process that fits all datasets!

<img src="images/guidelines.webp" width="80%">

#### The ideas here may help you structure your process

<aside class="notes">

  * First, a caveat:
  * This is not a one-size-all process to fit all datasets
  * You have to follow your nose, and do what seems appropriate for **your data** and **your goals**

## Gotta iterate fast!

<div style="display: flex; font-size: 0.8em;">

1. <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Ask questions</strong>
   * Brainstorm lots of them
   * Having a goal helps
2. <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Get answers</strong>
   * The faster the better
   * Familiarity with your tools helps
3. <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Document your findings</strong>
   * For others, but especially for future you!
4. <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>From what you learn, ask more questions</strong>
5. <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Clean your code!</strong>
   * Lay a solid foundation for the next iteration
   * Rename variables, write functions, add comments

</div>

<aside class="notes">

  * Exploratory data analysis is all about learning as much as you can
    about your data as efficiently as possible
  * Following an iterative process is a good way to check if you need to change direction
  * *go through steps*

<aside class="notes">

  * If all that sounds familiar, it might be because its basically the "scientific
    method" you might have learned at school
  * Start with a question, make a hypothesis, test it, document the result, and repeat

  * I can't emphasize the documentation part enough
  * You can end up repeating your analysis a few weeks or months down the track because you forgot to write down what you learned

## But what kinds of questions?

<div style="font-size: 0.95em;">

1. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->What <strong><em>variation</em></strong> can I see within this <em>individual</em> column?
   * Use summary statistics, plots of distribution
2. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->What <strong><em>covariation</em></strong> can I see between these columns?
   * Start with pairs of columns - e.g. scatter plots
   * The first step to **predicting one column from another** or
     **establishing a causal relationship**

## Variation within one column: Histograms / Bars

<div style="display: flex; margin-top: 0.8em;">
  <div>
    <h4 style="margin: 0;">Continuous Values</h4>
    <div style="font-size: 0.7em;">(numbers with decimal points)</div>

  <div>
    <h4 style="margin: 0;">Categorical Values</h4>
    <div style="font-size: 0.7em;">(string labels or small sets of integers)</div>
    <img style="margin: 0;" src="images/histogram-categorical.png">
  </div>
</div>

**Tip:** Try several bin widths for continuous columns!

<aside class="notes">

  * One of the simplest and most powerful visualisations is to simply plot the distribution of a column's values
  * We've seen these already today:
    * Histograms for continuous values - i.e. most numeric values
    * Frequency bar charts of categorical values, like categories or integers
  * For histograms, the width of the bins can have a big impact on the patterns you'll see, so try varying the number of bins in your plot

## Distribution follow-up questions

* <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Which values are common or rare? Why?</strong>
  * E.g. If most ratings are above 4.0, 4.1 is pretty bad
  * E.g. Are outlier prices correct? Are they relevant?
* <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Any unusual patterns? What might explain them?</strong>
  * E.g. Spikes at whole-numbered ratings
* <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Any apparent subgroups/clusters of points?</strong>
  * How are clusters similar and how do they differ?

  * Looking at a distribution could lead to some follow-up questions like these

### Covariation: Continuous vs Continuous

<div style="display: flex; margin-top: 0.8em;">
  <div>
    <h4 style="margin: 0;">Scatter Plots</h4>
    <img style="margin: 0;" src="images/scatter.png">
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 style="margin: 0;">Heat Maps</h4>
    <img style="margin: 0;" src="images/heatmap.png">
  </div>
</div>

**Tip:** Make overlapping scatter points more visible with
transparency or random jitter to point positions

<aside class="notes">

  * Now looking at covariation between two columns, we need to consider whether each
    of the columns is continuous or categorical
  * If both columns are continuous, a scatter plot is the classic approach
  * But too many overlapping points can make it hard to compare the density of points in some areas
  * You could try making points partially transparent so that denser regions appear darker
  * Or sometimes adding a small random number to each point can help spread points away from a specific location - like a whole number
  * Also, heatmaps might be clearer than scatter plots in some cases

    <img style="margin: 0;" src="images/cont-vs-cat-boxplot.png">
  </div>
</div>

(we'll see similar examples in the next tutorial)

<aside class="notes">

  * There are several ways to look at covariation between a continuous column and a categorical column
  * They generally rely on plotting the distribution of the continous column for each categorical value
  * For example, plotting in a different colour for each category
  * ...or completely separate subplots
  * Box plots are well suited for this because they let us easily compare medians and other quartiles of distributions while still seeing outliers
  * We're going to see how to make plots like these in the final tutorial

  <img style="margin: 0; width: 75%;" src="images/categorical-heatmap.png">
</div>

<aside class="notes">

  * Finally, when looking at covariation between two categorical columns
  * ...we can use stacked bar charts, where one categorical column's values are along the x-axis while the other's are stacked in different colours
  * ...or we could use a heatmap showing the frequency of combinations of values from the two columns

## Follow-up questions from covariation plots

* **How can you describe the relationship?**
* **How strong is the relationship?**
* **What other variables might affect it?**
* **Does the relationship change for subgroups?**

<aside class="notes">

  * Here are some questions you might ask about the covariation between two columns
  * *first two points*
  * Points 3 and 4: Is there another variable that needs to be considered along with these two,
  * ...or could the relationship be different for different subsets of the data?
  * For example, maybe a poor rating is only a reliable indicator of quality if the number of reviews is high enough

## Common gotchas

<div style="font-size: 0.9em;">

* <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Pay attention to missing values</strong>
  * `NaN`s are omitted from plots, but may be important
* <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Check data quality</strong>
  * Test even your most basic assumptions
* <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Be cautious testing hypotheses suggested by the data</strong>
  * If 1/100 columns is correlated, is it a coincidence?
* <!-- .element class="fragment" --><strong>Always be skeptical</strong>
  * Is this pattern or apparent clustering a coincidence? An
    artifact of the data collection process?

</div>

<aside class="notes">

  * Finally, a few common gotchas to keep in mind
  * *Point 1*
  * Point 2: Data is almost never as correct as we'd like it to be
  * Point 3:
    * There's a lot you can read out there about statistical significance and trusting results
    * But it's especially important to be careful when we're exploring the data as opposed to testing a predetermined hypothesis
    * If you look for a correlation between hundreds of columns, chances are you might find one exists purely by chance
    * That's not to say you shouldn't explore the data - just be skeptical of trusting relationships you find
  * *Point 4*

  * We've gone over a lot in a short space of time today
  * So I'd recommend reviewing this material and completing any exercises you didn't finish
  * And I've included a bunch of links here to places you can learn more Python and statisics,
    ...and for moving on to modelling your data with machine learning and AI tools
  * There's lots of great learning material out there, but these are the
    resources I'm familiar with
  * PyNoon is an initiative started by myself and Grant Paton-Simpson

### Most importantly: Practice your skills!

1. **Find a dataset you're passionate about**
   * [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
   * [data.govt.nz](https://www.data.govt.nz/)
2. **Brainstorm interesting questions**
   * Feel free to change direction as you learn more about the data
3. **Share your findings!**
   * Email your HTML notebook to others
   * Publish your notebooks on Kaggle, Github, GitLab
