## Instructions to helpers

Hi all,

Thank you very much for volunteering to be a helper at the
**Exploratory data analysis with Python** workshop at Kiwi Pycon, we
wouldn't be able to cater for so many learners without you!

If you would like to familiarise yourself with the content ahead of
time, I have made all of the slides and tutorial notebooks available
at the following links:

* The versions of the notebooks that I will be taking the attendees
  through - these contain empty cells for them to fill in as they go:
  https://ben-denham.github.io/python-eda
* Speaker notes and fully completed (i.e. runnable) versions of the
  notebooks that you can use as "model answers":
  https://ben-denham.github.io/python-eda/speaker

Also, here are some tips that I've found make for effective helping:

1. Be on the look out for anyone looking for help - attendees will be
   instructed to raise their hand, but may not always do so.
2. During the hands-on exercises at the end of each tutorial, feel
   free to wander around and look at what people are working on so
   that they feel more comfortable asking for help.
3. When assisting someone, avoid typing on their keyboard for them -
   it's best for them to have the experience of typing out a solution
   for themselves.
4. If there's ever a problem that you are not sure how to resolve,
   please feel free to seek assistance from another helper or from
   myself (during the breaks between presenting).

If you have any questions about the workshop or content, please feel
free to flick me an email.

Kind regards,
Ben Denham


## Instructions to attendees

Hi all,

We're looking forward to seeing you at the **Exploratory data analysis
with Python** workshop at Kiwi Pycon!

In preparation for the workshop, could you please make sure you are
ready to use the Google Colab online notebook interface, which we will
all be using during the workshop to ensure we have :

1. Open https://colab.google/
2. Click the `New Notebook` button
   * You will be prompted to login with a Google account if you are
     not already logged in
3. Type `1+1` into the empty prompt/cell, then press the `Enter` key
   *while holding the Shift key* to run it
4. After a short delay while the notebook starts, you should see the
   result: `2`
5. If you have any issues running these steps, please let us know as
   soon as possible

Also, when you arrive at Kiwi Pycon on Friday, please make sure you
can connect to the Conference WiFi or have another source of Internet
connectivity in order to connect to Google Colab and other workshop
resources.

Kind regards,
Ben Denham
