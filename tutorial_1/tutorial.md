# Tutorial 1: Loading and Visualising

In this tutorial... TODO

## Jupyter Notebooks

* **Jupyter notebooks** are a very popular platform for Python coding,
  particularly for data analysis and visualisation.
* We are running Jupyter notebooks in **Google Colab** so that you
  don't need to install Python or Jupyter on your own computer.
  * Note: Because your notebooks will run on Google's servers, you
    shouldn't upload any company data or code you are not authorised
    to use outside of company-approved systems.
* Jupyter notebooks can also be run on your own desktop or server with
  a piece of software called **JupyterLab**.

In the empty *cell* below, type `1 + 1` and then **press the `Enter`
key *while holding* the `Shift` key** to run the code:
